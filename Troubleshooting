## After uploading my code for ESP32 WhatsApp Messaging, I changed the message inside of the brackets from the function void sendMessage(String message), not realizing that this line should remain as is. When I hit upload I got an error message saying variable or field "sendMessage" declared void. I realized that i should've kept that line as is and change the message at the bottom of the code.
